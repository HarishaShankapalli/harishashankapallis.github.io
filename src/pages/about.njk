    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>{{ site.siteName }}</strong> â€” a space where creativity meets technology.  
      This project was built to showcase the power of the Jamstack approach: fast, secure, and scalable web experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Iâ€™m passionate about building modern applications with clean design and performance in mind.  
      Using tools like <strong>Gulp</strong>, <strong>Nunjucks</strong>, and a modular workflow, this site demonstrates how static sites can still feel dynamic and elegant.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond just development, the theme "Purple Elegance" represents my vision of combining aesthetics and functionality,  
      ensuring every project not only works smoothly but also looks beautiful.
